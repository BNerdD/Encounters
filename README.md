# Encounters
A simple Android App to walk people through a tour of artefacts in the British Museum.
The tour asks the question 'How far back into the Old Testament story can we walk and touch artefacts on display in the museum?'
The App was built for an earlier version of Android using CardViews and RecyclerViews.
